<u><b>VB codes powering MS Office Suite tools</b></u>

This repository contains codes written for tasks automation and fastening purposes, within the context of processing daily administrative and financial workloads, as well as contributing to periodical reporting, budget follow-up and account closings.

<b>MASTERFILE</b>

The first code, a VBA subprocedure, has been written with the purpose of gathering data, lying originally in different .xls files, withing in a single centralized file under the form of a single continued list. The raw data in question is the registered time (hh:mm:ss), entered by every staff member, in weekly time registration files. Every row is a unique entry, where the staff member enters his/her ID, the code of the project s/he worked on, the description of the entry, and the time (hh:mm:ss).
The .xls files containing the data are grouped inside a single folder, with a .xls file for every week of the calendar year (folder meant thus to contain 52 .xls files by the end of the calendar year).
