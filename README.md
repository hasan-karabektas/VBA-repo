<u><b>VB codes powering MS Office Suite tools</b></u>

This repository contains codes written for tasks automation and fastening purposes, within the context of processing daily administrative and financial workloads, as well as contributing to periodical reporting, budget follow-up and account closings.

<u><b>Masterfile</b></u>

This code, a VBA subprocedure, named Masterfile, has been written with the purpose of gathering data, lying originally in different .xls files, within in a single centralized masterfile under the form of a single continued list. The raw data in question is the registered time (hh:mm:ss), entered by every staff member, in weekly time registration files along with other information. Every row is a unique entry, where the staff member enters his/her ID, the code of the task s/he worked on, the description of the entry, and the time (hh:mm:ss) which was spent.
The .xls files containing the data are located inside a single folder, with one .xls file being assigned for every week of the calendar year (hence, the folder being meant to contain 52 .xls files by the end of the calendar year). 
The VBA macro code I wrote is a nested Do While Loop; with the first loop based on the directory and the .xls files being saved therein, and the second loop being based on cells within each cell range inside the concerned sheet of the specific weekly time registration file (having been activated in the first loop). An integer type variable is being incremented from 1 onwards, inside the first loop.
The code works succesfully, by opening every xls file in the folder, activating the relevant sheet before copying every row containing time registration data of the week in question, then returning to the Masterfile where the data is centralized, with every copied row being pasted to the last plus one cell containing data. Thanks to the variable being put inside the first loop, we could track which week (1 to 52) of the year any given entry pertains to. This information is being added to the masterfile, with the fifth column (column e) of every row being annotated with the week reference of the time registration entry. Once the collection of data is the centralized file is complete, the macro adapts the format of the column containing the time to a proper time-number format in Ms Excel, the macro is being fully run. The data centralized in the masterfile is then ready for further analysis and registration.

<b>Email_Automation</b>

Based on a For Each Next Loop integrating an inner condition, this code generates automated emails via the outlook emailing app, using a text template as message body, and customizing each email to be sent on the basis of data retrieved from an .xls file's table; with one email being sent for each row, insofar as the conditions which were set out are being met. Each email is dispatched based on variables referencing the key information (name and email address of the addressee, and other information) which are retrieved from the relevant columns of the active row. 
The code starts with the declaration of object variables to activate and refers to relevant applications and files, as well as to the table from which most of the variable data shall be retrieved. Later, the email is composed with the referencing of variables; the body of the message is in html format, so that customized, ad hoc adaptations to the format can be performed easily. The outlook signature of the user is also included in the emails which are going to be forwarded. The running of the code is completed with the dispatching of the emails for all rows.
